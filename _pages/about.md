I recently attained a PhD in biomechanics, having previously studied sport and exercise science. I am curious about all aspects of human movement, especially in the context of athletic performance.  
I am captivated by innovative solutions that tackle longstanding problems and address unresolved questions. I am particularly interested in exploring how new technologies and computational methods, specifically from the areas of computer vision and machine learning, can be used in the field of human movement biomechanics.  

Education
------

Having spent my formative years abroad, I returned to Germany to obtain a Bachelor's and Master's degree at the Technical University of Munich.  
After finishing my Master's degree and spending a year as a biomechanics researcher at my alma mater, I decided it was time to go abroad again. So, in 2018, I moved to Brisbane to pursue a PhD in biomechanics at the University of Queensland under the guidance of [A/Prof Luke Kelly](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=4oen8loAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra) and [Prof Andy Crewsswell](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=MGG3Bs8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

Professional experience
------

I have experience working in a variety of settings, from innovative sports technology companies to world-renowned universities and sports organisations.  
In each of my roles, I have had the opportunity to work with and learn from brilliant people. I have also been able to apply my theoretical understanding of human biomechanics and advance my skills in data acquisition, processing and analysis across a diverse range of contexts.
