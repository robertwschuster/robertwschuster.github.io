I am a biomechanist, with a background in sport science, interested in all aspects of human movement, especially in the context of athletic performance. 
New approaches to solving long-standing porblems and addressing enduring questions fascinate me. Accordingly, I enjoy exploring new technologies and computational methods, particularly in the areas of computer vision and machine learning.

Education
------
Despite spending my school years outside my country of origin, Germany, I returned home to complete a Bachelor and Master of Science at the Technical University of Munich. The itchy feet I got from spending such an extended period in my hometown, led me to undertake a PhD in biomechanics at the University of Queensland under the guidance of [A/Prof Luke Kelly](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=4oen8loAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra) and [Prof Andy Crewsswell](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=MGG3Bs8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

Professional experience
------
I have experience working in a variety of settings, from innovative sports tech companies to world-renowned universities and sports organisations. In each of my roles, I have had the opportunity to work with and learn from brilliant minds. I have also been able to apply my theoretical knowledge of human biomechanics, while developing new skills.


For a more detailed description on my education and professional experience, please take a look at my [CV](/files/CV_202306.pdf). An overview of my research to date can be found [here](/_pages/portfolio) and a list of my publications [here](/_pages/publications).
