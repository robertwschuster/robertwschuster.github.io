I recently completed a PhD in biomechanics, having previously studied sport and exercise science. I am interested in all aspects of human movement, especially in the context of athletic performance.  
New approaches to solving long-standing problems and addressing persisting questions fascinate me. Accordingly, I aim to continue exploring the application of new technologies and computational methods in the field of human movement biomechanics, particularly from the areas of computer vision and machine learning.

Education
------

Despite spending my school years outside my country of origin, Germany, I returned to complete a Bachelor and Master of Science at the Technical University of Munich.  
After completing the Master's degree and spending a year as a biomechanics researcher at my alma mater, I felt it was time to go abroad again. Hence, I moved to Brisbane in 2018 to undertake a PhD in biomechanics at the University of Queensland under the guidance of [A/Prof Luke Kelly](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=4oen8loAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra) and [Prof Andy Crewsswell](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=MGG3Bs8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

Professional experience
------

I have experience working in a variety of settings, from innovative sports tech companies to world-renowned universities and sports organisations.  
In each of my roles, I have had the opportunity to work with and learn from brilliant people. I have also had the chance to apply my theoretical knowledge of human biomechanics and develop my data acquisition, processing and analysis skills across a diverse range of contexts.
