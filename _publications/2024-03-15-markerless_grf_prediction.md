## Abstract  
Measuring or estimating the forces acting on the human body during movement is critical for determining the biomechanical aspects relating to injury, disease and healthy ageing. In this study we examined whether quantifying whole-body motion (segmental accelerations) using a commercial markerless motion capture system could accurately predict three-dimensional ground reaction force during a diverse range of human movements: walking, running, jumping and cutting. We synchronously recorded 3D ground reaction forces (force instrumented treadmill or in-ground plates) with high-resolution video from eight cameras that were spatially calibrated relative to a common coordinate system. We used a commercially available software to reconstruct whole body motion, along with a geometric skeletal model to calculate the acceleration of each segment and hence the whole-body centre of mass and ground reaction force across each movement task. The average root mean square difference (RMSD) across all three dimensions and all tasks was 0.75N/kg, with the maximum average RMSD being 1.85N/kg for running vertical force (7.89% of maximum). There was very strong agreement between peak forces across tasks, with R<sup>2</sup> values indicating that the markerless prediction algorithm was able to predict approximately 95â€“99% of the variance in peak force across all axes and movements. The results were comparable to previous reports using whole-body marker-based approaches and hence this provides strong proof-of-principle evidence that markerless motion capture can be used to predict ground reaction forces and therefore potentially assess movement kinetics with limited requirements for participant preparation.
