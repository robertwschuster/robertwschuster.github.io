A comprehensive dataset (N = 100) consisting of 3D foot scans under varying loads (captured as described [elsewhere](/portfolio/2020-01-foot_ssm_reliability)) as well as 3D motion tracking and ground reaction forces during various walking and running tasks was used to assess how accurately foot mechanics can be predicted from foot shape characteristics.  
` `  
To construct a foot shape-function model (SFM) principal component (PC) scores from a statistical shape model were combined with time normalised foot joint kinematics and kinetics. A principal component analysis was then performed to determine the main sources of covarying shape and function parameters.
` `

The main sources of shape variation were the longitudinal (PC1) and transverse (PC2) arches, relative foot proportions and toe shape (PC3) along with their associated joint mechanics.

Amongst the largest sources of variation in joint mechanics were midtarsal joint range of motion (ROM) throughout stance, and differences in ankle, subtalar, midtarsal and tarsometatarsal joint moments uring early and late stance when walking uphill (PC1). Further variations included differences in ankle, subtalar, midtarsal, and tarsometatarsal joint moments during level running (PC2), and subtalar, midtarsal, tarsometatarsal and MTP joint moments throughout stance, regardless of locomotor task (PC3).

A leave-one-out analysis showed that the SFM can be used to accurately predict foot joint angles and moments from external foot shape.  
` `  
Despite accounting for the largest amount of the overall variation in foot shape and joint mechanics, the three largest SFM PCs only accounted for a small proportion each (16, 10 and 8%, respectively), most likely due to the high structural complexity and variability of the foot.
