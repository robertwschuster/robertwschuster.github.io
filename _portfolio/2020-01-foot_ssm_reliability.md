This research investigated whether repeated foot scans captured by two examiners produce the same 3D shape and consistent statistical shape models.

A group of feet were scanned twice by two examiners. Each foot was scanned while bearing three different loads.  
- The shape of the resulting 3D meshes were compared across time points and between examiners using maximum, mean and root mean square (RMS) surface to surface distances.  
- The statistical shape models constructed for each time point and examiner were compared using three statistical shape model quality criteria.

Surface to surface distances between corresponding foot meshes and differences between shape model quality criteria were both found to be small and insignificant.

Furthermore, Euclidean vectors were used to model the magnitude and direction of deformation that feet undergo as a consequence of increased loading.
