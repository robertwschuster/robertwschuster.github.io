*This research was carried out during an industry placement at [![VALD](/images/vald_logo.png "VALD Inc."){: .align-right width="80px"}](https://vald.com)
` `  
As a proof of concept, the reliability of dynamic, single-joint, strength assesments conducted with a handheld dynamometer was examined.  
![Example of force-velocity assessment using handheld dynamometer](/images/vald_cover.png){: .align-center}
` `  
The reliability of the 
- range of motion, 
- mean angular velocity and 
- joint work 
<a/>  

was assessed using the 
- standard error of measurement, 
- coefficient of variation and 
- intraclass correlation coefficient.
